  "description": "The NERC-funded Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds (MAC) project was 
  centred on an aircraft campaign measuring clouds, aerosols, and boundary layer
  properties over the Weddell Sea, Antarctica. These data are simulations of
  a case study from the campaign (27-November-2015), comprising two separate flights 
  over the same region, with the Polar-optimised Weather Research and Forecasting 
  (PWRF) model. Each simulation used two domains -- a parent domain with 5km grid
  size and a nest with a 1km grid size. 
  \n\n This dataset contains data from the CNTRL simulation parent and nested domains. 
  \n\n Physics options were as default in the PWRF model's Morrison microphysics scheme, 
  with an approximation of the DeMott et al., 2010 (PNAS) parametrization used for primary 
  ice nucleation. 
  \n\n Methodology and further details can be found in Young et al., 2019 (GRL): 
  Radiative effects of secondary ice enhancement in coastal Antarctic clouds.",

    "description": "The Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds (MAC) campaign was a NERC funded consortium project to 
    make airborne measurements of coastal Antarctic clouds to inform model parametrization improvements. Although 
    there are many measurements of cloud microphysical properties at mid latitudes, these measurements are largely 
    lacking in Antarctica. With little observational data, our understanding of high latitude cloud physics is poor 
    and is thought to be responsible for large model errors in the surface radiation balance over the Southern Ocean 
    and the coast of Antarctica.

    \n\n The airborne component of the MAC campaign took place in November and December 2015 based out of Halley 
    research station. It used the BAS instrumented Twin Otter to take detailed measurements of the physical cloud 
    properties – size spectrums and phase (whether the particles are ice or liquid) – and the environment 
    around the clouds. 

    \n\n Within MAC, model simulations were conducted with the Polar-optimised Weather Research and Forecasting (PWRF)
    model (https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) at cloud-resolving spatial resolution.
    With grid sizes of 5 km and 1 km respectively for the parent domain and nest, all cloud microphysical processes
    were represented by the microphysics scheme (Morrison et al., 2005 (JAS)) alone. Our aircraft measurements were
    used for comparison with these simulations to identify model weaknesses and make appropriate cloud physics 
    improvements. Specifically, the representation of secondary ice production via the rime-splintering, or Hallett-
    Mossop, process was investigated as ice enhancement is a key contributor to cloud lifetime in Antarctica which
    we poorly understand.",
