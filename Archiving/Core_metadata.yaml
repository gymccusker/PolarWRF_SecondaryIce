  "description": "This dataset contains cloud particle number and mass measurements concentration measurements from the 
  University of Manchester's 2-Dimensional Stereo (2DS, SPEC Inc.) probe mounted on board the British Antarctic Survey 
  Twin Otter aircraft durning Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds (MAC) campaign. 
  \n\nMAC took place during November and December 2015, based out of the Halley Research Station on the Brunt Ice Shelf. This 
  dataset includes data from the 18 MAC flights (flight numbers 218 to 235) over which the 2DS was taking measurements. 
  The instrument was mounted on the aircraft wing. Data processing was performed to derive size- and circularity-segregated 
  number and mass concentrations as in Crosier et al. (2011, 2014). Particles with inter-arrival times < 1E-6s have been 
  rejected. The sample area was calculated using the all-in approach (Heymsfield and Parrish, 
  doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1978)017<1566:ACTFIT>2.0.CO;2, 1978). Particles in contact with the edge of the 
  sample array have been rejected.
  \n\nThe MAC campaign was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC, grant: NE/K01305X/1). ",

    "description": "The Microphysics of Antarctic Clouds (MAC) campaign was a NERC funded consortium project to 
    make airborne measurements of coastal Antarctic clouds to inform model parametrization improvements. Although 
    there are many measurements of cloud microphysical properties at mid latitudes, these measurements are largely 
    lacking in Antarctica. With little observational data, our understanding of high latitude cloud physics is poor 
    and is thought to be responsible for large model errors in the surface radiation balance over the Southern Ocean 
    and the coast of Antarctica.

    \n\n The airborne component of the MAC campaign took place in November and December 2015 based out of Halley 
    research station. It used the British Antarctic Survey's instrumented Twin Otter aircraft to take detailed 
    measurements of the physical cloud properties – size spectrums and phase (whether the particles are ice or 
    liquid) – and the environment around the clouds. Within MAC, the University of Manchester's 2DS was fitted to 
    the Twin Otter aircraft to make cloud particle measurements at high spatial and temporal resolution, thus providing
    more information about the phase distribution of the sampled clouds.",
